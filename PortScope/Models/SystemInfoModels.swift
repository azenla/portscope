//
//  Top-of-stack "About this Mac"-style facts: SoC family, CPU/GPU
//  topology, installed memory, internal NVMe, OS + firmware versions.
//  Everything in here is read from `sysctl` + `system_profiler` rather
//  than IOKit directly — the kernel exposes most of these facts only
//  through `IOPlatformExpertDevice` properties that don't survive the
//  generic `NodeBuilder` pipeline cleanly. Surfaced as the first row
//  inside the **Internal Hardware** sidebar section so the user lands
//  on a one-glance overview of the host they're inspecting.
